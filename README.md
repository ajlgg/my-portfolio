# my-portfolio
I made this repository for my personal portfolio website. The website showcases my projects, experience, skils, and contact information, and is built with React and TailwindCSS. The site is deployed using Github Pages.

**If you would like to use my template for your own portfolio:**

You can change or add how the UI looks after cloning the code.
